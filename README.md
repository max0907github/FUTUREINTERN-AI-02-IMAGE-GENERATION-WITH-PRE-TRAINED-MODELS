# Image Generation with Pre-Trained Models

## Overview
This project implements image generation using pre-trained models based on a dataset of prompts and generated responses.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `torch`, `torchvision`, `transformers`, `pillow`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>

    ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells in order to load the dataset and generate images.
3. The generated images will be saved in the current directory.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `ManaGPT-1020_4080_prompts_and_generated_texts.csv`, which contains various prompts for image generation.
